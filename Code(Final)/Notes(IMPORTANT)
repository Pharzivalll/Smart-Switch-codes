In order for the code of the nodeMCU to work, certain libraries need to be installed on your system, here is the specific gudie you should follow:

To install the libraries for the ESP32 and Blynk, you’ll need to follow these steps:

### 1. Install the ESP32 Core in Arduino IDE
If you haven’t already set up your Arduino IDE for ESP32, you’ll need to install the ESP32 board support first.

1. **Open Arduino IDE**.
2. **Go to** `File` > `Preferences`.
3. In the **Additional Board Manager URLs** field, enter:
   ```
   https://raw.githubusercontent.com/espressif/arduino-esp32/gh-pages/package_esp32_index.json
   ```
   If there are other URLs there, separate them with a comma.
4. **Go to** `Tools` > `Board` > `Boards Manager`.
5. In the Boards Manager, search for **ESP32**.
6. **Install** the **esp32** package by **Espressif Systems**.

Once installed, you can select your ESP32 board from `Tools` > `Board`.

### 2. Install the Blynk Library

1. **Go to** `Sketch` > `Include Library` > `Manage Libraries`.
2. In the Library Manager, search for **Blynk**.
3. Find **Blynk by Volodymyr Shymanskyy** and click **Install**.

This installs the Blynk library and gives you access to all `BlynkSimple` headers, including `BlynkSimpleEsp32.h`.

### 3. Include Libraries in Your Code

After installing, add these lines to your code:

```cpp
#include <WiFi.h>             // For ESP32 WiFi
#include <BlynkSimpleEsp32.h>  // For Blynk with ESP32
```

Now you should be ready to upload the code to your ESP32!
